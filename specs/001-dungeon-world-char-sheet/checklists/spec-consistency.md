**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality and consistency across spec, plan, tasks, and data model.
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Feature**: [specs/001-dungeon-world-char-sheet/spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all required data fields in the Character entity explicitly covered by functional requirements (name, player, campaign, class, health, damage die, attributes, moves, notes)? [Completeness, Data Model §Root Entity]
- [x] CHK002 Are requirements defined for all localization deliverables referenced in the spec (labels, move names, move descriptions, UI strings)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008] (Move names are not explicitly called out.)
- [x] CHK003 Are requirements documented for language switching behavior beyond "without page reload" (e.g., persistence of chosen language across reloads)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK004 Are requirements stated for how data persistence applies to every editable field (including notes and attributes), not just general "character data"? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is the modifier table defined for all attribute values 1-18 with no gaps? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003] (Table stops at 18.)
- [x] CHK006 Is "typical internet connection" quantified with a specific network profile or metric for SC-001? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK007 Is the 90% success target in SC-003 defined with a measurable test method, sample size, and success rubric? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003]
- [x] CHK008 Is "displays correctly" in SC-004 defined with explicit criteria (layout, truncation, overflow, i18n) to reduce subjective interpretation? [Clarity, Spec §SC-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK009 Do attribute ranges align between the spec, data model, and edge-case guidance (1-18 vs clamp behavior)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Edge Cases, Data Model §Constraints & Validation] (Edge-case behavior is unresolved.)
- [x] CHK010 Are "editable fields" described in the user stories consistent with data model constraints (required vs optional, length limits)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Data Model §Constraints & Validation] (Length constraints are not stated in the spec.)
- [x] CHK011 Do moves counts and lists match across spec, plan, and data model (8 basic, 13 special; universal set)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005, Plan §Technical Context, Data Model §Localization Notes]
- [x] CHK012 Are persistence expectations consistent between spec and plan (auto-save, no manual save, local storage)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-007, Spec §SC-002, Plan §Technical Context]
- [x] CHK013 Are performance targets consistent between spec success criteria and plan performance goals (2s load vs 100ms rerender)? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001, Plan §Technical Context]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK014 Do all user stories define measurable outcomes beyond example scenarios (e.g., clear pass/fail criteria for each story)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK015 Are acceptance scenarios free of ambiguous terms like "clean" or "readable" without measurable definitions? [Clarity, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK016 Can SC-006 be objectively verified with a full table of attribute inputs or a defined sampling strategy? [Measurability, Spec §SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK017 Are alternate scenarios covered for localization (missing translation keys, partial locale files, mixed-language fallback)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [x] CHK018 Are scenarios defined for initial load when no prior data exists in local storage? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK019 Are scenarios defined for manual edits to health and attributes that violate constraints (e.g., current > max, values out of range)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases] (Scenarios are listed but outcomes are not defined.)

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK020 Are edge-case behaviors fully specified for each listed issue (range violations, max health overflows, blank name, navigation away)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK021 Is "allow or warn user" for blank name resolved into a single required behavior? [Ambiguity, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK022 Is the notes length expectation aligned between spec (no limit) and data model guidance (5000+ chars practical)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006, Data Model §Constraints & Validation]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK023 Are accessibility requirements explicitly defined (keyboard navigation, focus states, screen reader labels) beyond the Phase 7 tasks? [Gap, Plan §Phase 7]
- [x] CHK024 Are cross-browser compatibility requirements specified at the requirement level (not just in tasks), with explicit supported versions? [Gap, Spec §SC-004]
- [x] CHK025 Are performance requirements limited to page load only, or is interactive responsiveness also specified? [Gap, Spec §SC-001, Plan §Technical Context]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK026 Are the assumptions about hardcoded moves and no backend documented as explicit scope boundaries with risks? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK027 Are dependency license requirements paired with a documented process for validating new dependencies? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies & Licensing]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK028 Are any conflicting requirements called out between spec and plan (e.g., attribute layout: single line vs grid on smaller screens)? [Conflict, Spec §FR-002, Plan §Phase 7] (Spec requires single-line layout; plan suggests 3x2 grid on small screens.)
- [x] CHK029 Is there a clear requirement for class display (free text vs enum), given the data model enum for Class? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Data Model §Enums]
- [x] CHK030 Is the requirement for damage die display aligned with the enum values and localization policy (localized label vs canonical value)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Data Model §Enums, Data Model §Localization Notes]
